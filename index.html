                <p>Born in Santa Barbara, CA in 1967, Peter was the youngest of three siblings. He played a variety of sports growing up, but took a specific liking to surfing at a young age. He gives his older brother some credit for this, who he says would often "peer pressure him into paddling out when it was probably a little dangerous for someone of [his] age." He began playing volleyball, both beach and indoor, in high school and he carried this hobby with him through college and well into adulthood. In fact, it was through beach volleyball that he was introduced to my mom! </p>

                <p>After completing high school, Peter went on to attend UC Berkeley to pursue a degree in physics. He fondly looks back on his college years as some of the best of his life, and insists that the 1980s were the "golden era" for UC Berkeley, a statement that clearly comes with no attached bias. He received his undergraduate degree from Berkeley in 1988. </p>

                <p>Upon graduating college, Peter made a point to travel around the world before he began his "real-world duties." He and his best friend embarked on an eight month trip which took them all across Europe, Asia, and Oceania. He believes that going on this trip was one of the best decisions he's ever made, as the experience was both fun, educational, and offered new life perspectives. </p>

        <p>When he returned from his travelling, Peter knew he wanted to return to graduate school to pursue his Ph.D. However, he decided to switch his studies to history after not performing as well as he would have liked on a physics placement exam. He received his Ph.D from UC Berkeley in 1999, the year I was born, and began his career as a researcher and professor. Because of his attachment to his hometown, Peter has always made living in Santa Barbara a priority, often sacrificing job offers so that he could stay in familiar territory. After a year-long stint as a professor on the East Coast, Peter returned back to Santa Barbara, which is where he resides today with his wife, dog, and two sons. He currently teaches history of science at USC, and is often writing books on the side. He spends his free time doing many of the same activities he enjoyed as a kid: surfing, hiking, and volleyball. He still loves to travel, and makes a point of scheduling a family backpacking trip every summer in the Sierras. </p>

                <p>With his two kids now off at college, Peter looks forward to spending more time playing music, travelling, and getting outdoors as he adapts to life as an "empty nester." He has several bucket-list family trips planned for life after COVID-19, and hopes that sooner rather than later, his two kids will be making enough money to pay for them. </p>
